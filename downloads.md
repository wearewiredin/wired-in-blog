### Presets

You can create custom sign statuses for easy switching. Each status can have a unique (or even shared color). Statuses have an assigned emoji. That way when your status posts to Slack, or another webhook, it can post the name and emoji.

### Shortcuts

Power control your sign quickly and easily with hotkey shortcuts. Every color can have it's own shortcut key, and you can have a separate shortcut key for turning the sign off.
