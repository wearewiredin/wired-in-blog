We've had some fun on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/p/z-hgKeCiLi/?modal=true) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wearewiredin) leading up to today, but enough teasers. We have an announcement:

We're selling an advance run of 150 signs starting [right now](http://store.wearewired.in). These are our entry level aluminum and acrylic Wired In desktop signs, and we couldn't be prouder to do this early release. We've had so many people ask about getting signs ASAP that we're happy to oblige.

So what are you buying if you buy today?

Battery powered, switch enabled aluminum base  
Removable 'Wired In' acrylic pane  
Diffused red LED light  
$29 shipped in 30 days  

Team orders of 10 or more can order custom text or vector file for the acrylic design.

We're hard at work on our Bluetooth multi-colored models, but they won't be ready until mid-Summer at the earliest. If you want to wait until then, we don't blame you, they're going to be really awesome! So no hard feelings. But if you want to get your hands on one of these and start signaling you're busy ASAP, [now's your chance](http://store.wearewired.in). First come, first serve, [until they're gone](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m26nvnNG5o1qkk10ro1_500.jpg).

More to come soon!
