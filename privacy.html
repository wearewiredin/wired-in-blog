## Privacy Statement

Wired In and its subsidiaries respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

Your visit on our Website becomes part of our records; however, our records only contain your IP address, the date and time of your visit and the specific sites you visited. In general, it is not possible for Wired In to determine your identity. Evaluation of the recorded data is done on an anonymous basis and exclusively for statistical purposes. For publicly accessible data, only the domain name and the top-level domain name of your IP address are shown.

We believe very strongly in our customers’ right to privacy. Our customer records are not for sale or trade.

Wired In will use customers’ e-mail addresses only to supply information relating to orders and for customer relationship maintenance purposes. The exchange of customer data over the Internet is encrypted. This is accomplished by using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Customers can subscribe and unsubscribe to the Wired In newsletter on the website. Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time.

Wired In will not share any personal customer data with third parties other than with service partners who require the data in order to process orders. To enable the customer to place orders in the Online Store, a so-called “cookie” will be created when particular Web pages are visited. These are small files. The customer may use his browser program to control the acceptance of cookies from the Web page and, if appropriate, block this. Such cookies serve exclusively to enable the use of specific applications, e.g. the Online Store shopping basket system; no personal data whatsoever is stored.

In the event of questions regarding the collection, processing or use of your personal data and for information, the amendment, blocking or deletion of data and the revocation of consents granted, customers should contact Wired In Customer Service in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. E-mail: hello@wearewired.in.
